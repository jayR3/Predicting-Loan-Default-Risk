Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with locations in the western
United States of America. The past few years have resulted in stagnant growth at the coffee
chain, and a new management team was put in place to reignite growth at their stores. The first
initiative by the new team is to conduct an experiment about their new product.

As the business analyst of Round Roasters Company, Iâ€™ve been asked to analyze the results of
the experiment to determine whether the menu changes should be applied to all stores.
The predicted impact to profitability should be enough to justify the increased marketing budget:
at least 18% increase in profit growth compared to the comparative period while compared to
the control stores; otherwise known as incremental lift.
